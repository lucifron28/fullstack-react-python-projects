# Full-Stack React Projects: JS/TS + Tailwind + FastAPI/Flask + SQLite

Welcome to my journey to master **React (JavaScript & TypeScript)** with **Tailwind CSS** and **Python backends (FastAPI/Flask)** using **SQLite** for rapid prototyping.

This repo contains 10 full-stack projects, progressing from beginner to intermediate level. Each project has two versions:
- ✅ JavaScript version
- ✅ TypeScript version

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Frontend: **React + Tailwind CSS**
- Backend: **FastAPI** or **Flask** (per project)
- Database: **SQLite**
- State Management: `useState`, `useContext`
- HTTP: `axios` or native `fetch`
